## 🌸 About Me

I'm a passionate front-end developer currently completing a full-time Software Development Bootcamp at CodeSpace Academy. I build responsive, inclusive, and memorable web experiences with a touch of flair and intention.

As a curious problem-solver, I’m always learning — from accessibility standards to design systems — blending code and creativity into everything I build. Whether it's face tracking apps, responsive UI components, or immersive layouts, I pour both logic and love into every pixel.
